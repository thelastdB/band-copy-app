‘Bad Behavior’ pulls straight from the old Delta blues playbook. A man does wrong, and the woman isn’t having it – she’s had enough of his running around from dusk till dawn. This song lays it out plain: mess around, and there’s a price to pay. Whether you believe in the devil, karma, or just plain consequences, the darkness is coming for you. And the worst part is that you’re too blind to notice. You work hard, you play harder, and somewhere in the middle of all that noise, you miss the warning signs. Meanwhile, she’s already headed down the road, humming a tune that says she’s done. ‘Bad Behavior’ isn’t about regret – it’s about what happens when you think you can get away with it, and find out you can’t.

There’s a moment when you hit the on-ramp in Oklahoma City, and no matter which direction you go, it’s a long way to where you’re headed. This tune is about movement—leaving something behind, chasing something ahead, or just watching the miles stack up without knowing exactly where they lead. With its twang, grit, and open-ended storytelling, this song captures the restless push forward; forgetting what you’ve learned, starting over, making a mess of it, and still showing up for the ride. Life isn’t about sitting on the sidelines, and I hope folks see “Long Way” as fitting soundtrack for their journeys, whatever the destination.
